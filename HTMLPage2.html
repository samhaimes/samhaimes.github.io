            <p>Sami has a mathematics background so can implement her problem solving and analytical skills into developing software. Her interest in the technology industry began with a fascination in the latest sporting technologies such as Hawkeye in Cricket and goal line technology in football as well as the analytics used in performance. She loved to research how they are implemented and the impact they have on the fairness (level playing field) of the sports. From this she developed an interest in general technology and therefore a desire to work as a software developer and create her own new technologies. She is very conscious of leading a healthy lifestyle by eating only plant-based food and going to the gym regularly. With data and digital being at the forefront of these lifestyles it has helped her realise the importance of the tech industry and how much it is used daily. Attending the gym regularly has also taught her discipline and perseverance by pushing herself to work harder each session and increase her strength. Sami is a very thoughtful person and has showing this by taking up the role of a COVID-19 Support Volunteer and has now become a reliable contact for any additional volunteering required in the community. This is also reflected in her work where she will be willing to go above and beyond the tasks she faces. </p>

            <div class="section-title">What interests you about the career you are about to embark on?</div>
            <p>The reason I have chosen to pursue a career in tech is because it complements by inquisitive personality as it is growing so fast and constantly evolving. There are not many things that affect every industry and person on the planet, and I want to be a part of this. I have seen the impact of technology in sport and the benefits of it and therefore want to be part of it. I am constantly looking around me and wondering the code that is used to produce everything and want to understand and be able to create this myself. As a consultant I will get the opportunity to have different experiences at different companies. I have shown I can adapt to new situations and be comfortable as I moved to France last year to work in a Ski Resort without knowing anyone there.</p>
